description: On being demotivated, and wanting to change everything.

I've been really demotivated as of late. I can say maybe... for the past 2-3 months, but realistically, much longer. I think it's simply, unfortunate, that I've managed to burnout at the ripe age of 15, but *que sera, sera*. 

It's not depression or anything, it's just this inane sense that everything I do, I don't enjoy and I've just gotten tired of trying to find new ***passions***. I spend my time doing the same, repetitive, boring things, with no goal in sight, or even worse, I try to fill my time with meaningless, fun things that don't have any long term benefit. I'm obsessing over the wrong things, and nothing really makes complete sense to me anymore.

This sense of demotivation has gotten significantly worse after I got sick 2 weeks ago. I don't know what I want to do anymore. I'm just really bored all the time, with everything. I hate it.

I always have these bursts of motivation which result in me wanting to pursue this idea that I have, and then not doing anything about it, because the second I sit down to try it I realize that I don't enjoy anything.

Shit man, I've been trying to find something interesting to me, but I feel like I've just been pretending these past couple of years. Programming, math, engineering, whatever, it's all been this facade that I've been trying to build to make me look like less of a loser. But that's what I am. A loser, without passion, because nothing's interesting to me anymore. I truly did peak in 2006. 

Don't get me wrong, I think the applicative properties of each of those "hobbies"/"passions" are great. Programming is wonderful for automation, math is great because it's the "language of the universe" and whatnot, and engineering is just so so so interesting, but I don't have the motivation (or the drive) to put in the work, and it's taken me 2 years to realize that.

Worst part is, I don't really know how to fix any of this. Maybe if I just keep pushing I'll find something I actually enjoy, or maybe I'll traverse life without any sense of direction. Both seem equally as fucked.

I have this dumb urge to change everything, and move everything around, just to see if it'll get my motivation juices flowing (spoiler alert: it doesn't). I've done this so many times: rewrites and deletions, and it never really works.
