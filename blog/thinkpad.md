description: Getting a brand new (to me) Thinkpad.
---

I got a Thinkpad, and it's been a pretty interesting addition towards my setup.

By new, I mean new to me. The Thinkpad's actually an old, refurbished Thinkpad SL410 with 8GB RAM and an Intel Core Duo, I managed to snag it for ~$75 CAD.

I've upgraded it to have an SSD, and replaced the CD media drive with a hard disk drive containing a 500GB hard drive. I may consider getting a hard drive with more gigage if required (which it's probably not).

It being a substantially older model means rather than having a modern, unresponsive chiclet keyboard, it has a modern keyboard that everyone on [r/thinkpad](https://reddit.com/r/thinkpad) fawns over. And to be fair, it's an awesome keyboard.

Although it's an excellent productivity machine, it's larger and heavier than I'm used to: 
- 14 inch screen (but the bezels make it seem **much** larger)
- weighs in at 2.4kg (~5.28lbs)
- **super** thiccc

But to be honest, the size isn't truly a problem, I was planning on working on building some muscle anyways and lugging this thing aroudn might just help me do so.

The one aspect that I **can** currently complain about is the battery life. It's, in a word, horrible. I've ordered a new 10.8V battery, but I think it's going to be a while before it arrives. Before the battery arrives, there's nothing I can really do other than, stay strapped to my desk (could be worse, though).

I really enjoy being a possessor of this laptop, although it can be slow at times, I think I just have to orient my usage towards less resource intensive tasks.

### Update (07-07)

My battery came in today, and I'm going to perform some tests to see how long it lasts. It should last a solid 2-3 hours when I'm just writing. Looking forward to take this machine out of the house more often.
