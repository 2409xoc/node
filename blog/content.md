I've been developing [pseudohenry.xyz](/) for ~10 days, and although it's not even close to done... or good, it's developed to a point where it should be reasonably effective to host some forms of content. 

Many features must be added, and refactoring leading to optimizations of those features must be done, but I don't want to spend all my time building the frame of a site just to have... absolutely nothing. Sometimes smaller details can be ignored. I've been so busy working on the aesthetics (that don't even look that great), that many of the sub-pages in the header lead to 404s.
