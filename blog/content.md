I've been developing [pseudohenry.xyz](/) for ~10 days, and although it's not even close to done... or good, it's developed to a point where it should be reasonably effective to host some forms of content. 

Many features must be added, and refactoring leading to optimizations of those features must be done, but I don't want to spend all my time building the frame of a site just to have... absolutely nothing. Sometimes smaller details can be ignored. I've been so busy working on the aesthetics (that don't even look that great), that many of the sub-pages in the header lead to 404s.

## Wants

What do I want do come out of hosting and developing a website? 

At the end of the day, I just want this website to be able to host my ideas/projects. I want it to be my own personal corner of the Internet, a place where I do things solely because I want to, and for it to be an enjoyable experience for other to browse through.

I know for sure that I don't want popup ads, random and useless Javascript snippets, and anything that may hinder viewing experiences. I used to believe that a website devoid of Javascript with the beige 80s aesthetics was ideal, but now I understand that as long as everything serves a purpose (that isn't self-promotion, revenue, etc), it should be tolerable if managed correctly (so no mining bitcoin in the browser).

I want my site to be fast, which it already (sort of) is (kinda):

but I want it to maintain this kind of ***speed***. In sum, I just want to stay in touch with this site, and not let it get lost in the ocean of sites focused on revenue and selling something. I don't find any pleasure in losing touch with my values to make some extra money, although I am a teen and money isn't a priority in my life (a privilege I am fortunate enough to have).

### TLDR:
- Speed
- Hosting Projects & Content
- Readable, Entertaining, Comfy
- No shilling

## Content

While browsing for website development, I found [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27173728) interesting thread on Hacker News.

The first 2 paragraphs of the top comment reads:
> "I think the big number 1 that trumps all others when building a person website is: focus on writing content. This is by far the hardest part. All the other stuff: it's just tangential. Wordpress, Blogger, Jekyll, Hugo, Medium, hand-written HTML files: IMHO it doesn't really matter if you don't have any content. Just use whatever is easiest to get started with and gets out of your way when writing. For me, personally, it would be writing Markdown in Vim and converting that. For other people, it's something else."

I think that this is extremely great advice, the content part, not the writing Markdown in Vim part, although....

I have to stop thinking and writing about the types of content I'd like to host, and just start producing. This is probably the last time, I promise. I just need to plan everything out.

Alright, firstly. No deep emotional crap. No one needs to read about "deep" life-changing emotional ideas from a 15 year old kid. Going deep, in a scientific and factual sense is alright, but talking about emotions is a <big>big</big> no-no for me. Often, what I believe to be deep is the result of me being insanely myopic, and looking back, everything deep I've ever said are just repeated, plagiarized ideas.

Maybe, in some blog posts, I'll take about my emotions and thoughts, but I'll try my best not to push any ideas onto other people.

Other than that, everything else is practical free rein. 

When it comes to actual content, I have a **lot** of ideas that are mostly related to Programming and Computers. I might create a sub-site for just a list of ideas, and maybe it can be my first CRUD app. 

I think the main lesson I've learnt is that you have to stop trying to plan out how you'll do something, but just start doing. Which is truly ironic because this was a post about planning out the future of my site.

Plans are good. Incessant planning with no end? Not so great.
