        <p>Hey. I don't <strong>really</strong> know what to put here, I'm pretty bland to be honest. I'll try my best to make this an interesting about me. </p>
        <p><h2>My Life...</h2>is pretty cool.</p>
        <p>I'm a teenager fortunate enough to have the freedom to do whatever he pleases (as long as it's not illegal) as long as he lives upto a highly minimal set of requirements set by both my elders and peers. I was born in 2006, and just recently "graduated" 10th grade, meaning the more "difficult" years of high school are to come. I think the pressure is on?</p>
        <p><h2>I like...</h2> a splash of everything?</p>
        <p>My interests, in a word... fluid. Constantly changing, evolving (or devolving), I often scrap random topics that "fit" the general specs of what I would be interested in to try something completely new. Commitment is difficult.</p>
        <p>Although, no matter the evolving state of my interests, a rigid (and small) subset of interests have remained: Math and Computers, and sometimes video games. So specific, I know. I'm going to keep exploring different topics, and maybe, I'll document them here. </p>
        <p><h2>This Site...</h2> will (hopefully) not die. </p>
        <p>I cannot describe the amount of times I've created a site, just to lose motivation and for it to be scrapped after 3 days. I truly hope this site will be different. </p>
        <p>Content wise, I hope to be able to produce whatever I please, and never lose touch with myself. Read more: <a href="/blog/content">here</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm really proud of this site design, and I hope I don't ruin it. But risks must be taken... right?</p>

        <p>I'll try my best to make this an interestingly read site. </p>
