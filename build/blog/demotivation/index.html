        <p>I&#39;ve been really demotivated as of late. I can say maybe... for the past 2-3 months, but realistically, much longer. I think it&#39;s simply, unfortunate, that I&#39;ve managed to burnout at the ripe age of 15, but <em>que sera, sera</em>. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not depression or anything, it&#39;s just this inane sense that everything I do, I don&#39;t enjoy and I&#39;ve just gotten tired of trying to find new <em><strong>passions</strong></em>. I spend my time doing the same, repetitive, boring things, with no goal in sight, or even worse, I try to fill my time with meaningless, fun things that don&#39;t have any long term benefit. I&#39;m obsessing over the wrong things, and nothing really makes complete sense to me anymore.</p>
<p>This sense of demotivation has gotten significantly worse after I got sick 2 weeks ago. I don&#39;t know what I want to do anymore. I&#39;m just really bored all the time, with everything. I hate it.</p>
<p>I always have these bursts of motivation which result in me wanting to pursue this idea that I have, and then not doing anything about it, because the second I sit down to try it I realize that I don&#39;t enjoy anything.</p>
<p>Shit man, I&#39;ve been trying to find something interesting to me, but I feel like I&#39;ve just been pretending these past couple of years. Programming, math, engineering, whatever, it&#39;s all been this facade that I&#39;ve been trying to build to make me look like less of a loser. But that&#39;s what I am. A loser, without passion, because nothing&#39;s interesting to me anymore. I truly did peak in 2006. </p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think the applicative properties of each of those &quot;hobbies&quot;/&quot;passions&quot; are great. Programming is wonderful for automation, math is great because it&#39;s the &quot;language of the universe&quot; and whatnot, and engineering is just so so so interesting, but I don&#39;t have the motivation (or the drive) to put in the work, and it&#39;s taken me 2 years to realize that.</p>
<p>Worst part is, I don&#39;t really know how to fix any of this. Maybe if I just keep pushing I&#39;ll find something I actually enjoy, or maybe I&#39;ll traverse life without any sense of direction. Both seem equally as fucked.</p>
<p>I have this dumb urge to change everything, and move everything around, just to see if it&#39;ll get my motivation juices flowing (spoiler alert: it doesn&#39;t). I&#39;ve done this so many times: rewrites and deletions, and it never really works.</p>
