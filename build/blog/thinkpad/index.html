        <p>I got a Thinkpad, and it&#39;s been a pretty interesting addition towards my setup.</p>
<p>By new, I mean new to me. The Thinkpad&#39;s actually an old, refurbished Thinkpad SL410 with 8GB RAM and an Intel Core Duo, I managed to snag it for ~$75 CAD.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve upgraded it to have an SSD, and replaced the CD media drive with a hard disk drive containing a 500GB hard drive. I may consider getting a hard drive with more gigage if required (which it&#39;s probably not).</p>
<p>It being a substantially older model means rather than having a modern, unresponsive chiclet keyboard, it has a modern keyboard that everyone on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/thinkpad">r/thinkpad</a> fawns over. And to be fair, it&#39;s an awesome keyboard.</p>
<p>Although it&#39;s an excellent productivity machine, it&#39;s larger and heavier than I&#39;m used to: </p>
<ul>
<li>14 inch screen (but the bezels make it seem <strong>much</strong> larger)</li>
<li>weighs in at 2.4kg (~5.28lbs)</li>
<li><strong>super</strong> thiccc</li>
</ul>
<p>But to be honest, the size isn&#39;t truly a problem, I was planning on working on building some muscle anyways and lugging this thing around might just help me do so.</p>
<p>The one aspect that I <strong>can</strong> currently complain about is the battery life. It&#39;s, in a word, horrible. I&#39;ve ordered a new 10.8V battery, but I think it&#39;s going to be a while before it arrives. Before the battery arrives, there&#39;s nothing I can really do other than, stay strapped to my desk (could be worse, though).</p>

<p>I really enjoy being a possessor of this laptop, although it can be slow at times, I think I just have to orient my usage towards less resource intensive tasks.</p>
<h3 id="update-07-07">Update (07-07)</h3>
<p>My battery came in today, and I&#39;m going to perform some tests to see how long it lasts. It should last a solid 2-3 hours when I&#39;m just writing. Looking forward to take this machine out of the house more often.</p>
