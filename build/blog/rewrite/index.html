        <p>Welcome to the blog section of <strong>pseudohenry</strong>. Here, I write about whatever first comes to mind.</p>
<p>To serve this site, I&#39;m using a node application that compiles to a static site and my VPS server pulls that static site from Github every <em>x</em> amount of minutes using a crontab command (currently, x=1 - allowing me to see changes faster).</p>
<p>Everything within the blog system of my Node app is pretty standard (if not slightly inefficient):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a> server</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs">ejs</a> as a templater</li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/api/path.html">path</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-fs-module">fs</a> for simple file management</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/front-matter">front-matter</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked">marked</a> for markdown parsing to the ejs template</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-word-count">html-word-count</a> for the <em><strong>posh</strong></em> counting of words</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, building the static site requires much of the same process (just with generated html). The steps required are (for a fresh build):</p>
<ol>
<li>create build directory (/build/)</li>
<li>copy the /public/ folder to /build/ (containing src&#39;s: css and assets)</li>
<li>read a list of sub-pages, and build their directories within /build/ recursively</li>
<li>read index page for each sub-page (found in views) and generate html from its ejs template</li>
<li>for blog posts:<ol>
<li>read each blog markdown file (found in /blog/)</li>
<li>find ejs layout page (usually /views/blog.html)</li>
<li>compile blog markdown file into html and move it to /build/blog/{post_title}/index.html</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>create this directory recursively if it doesn&#39;t exist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty simple stuff, although, I&#39;m pretty positive the way I&#39;m approaching building the site is wrong. I&#39;m going to work on optimization and refactoring possible later.</p>
<p>This site is definitely an upgrade to my last couple sites where I used PHP as a backend for a lot of server-side scripts, and it was honestly, exhausting. Looking forward to developing this site over the summer.</p>
<p><strong>ps[1]:</strong> if your curious about the correlation between the reading time + number of words, I just set it as an approximation of 200 words read/min (a pretty simple rate)</p>
<p><strong>ps[2]:</strong> a lot of the hyperlinks don&#39;t truly work <em><strong>yet</strong></em> (06-29-2022) as those sub-pages currently don&#39;t have any content (should be fixed within the next couple of days).</p>
<h2 id="an-update-07-02">An Update (07-02):</h2>
<p>Today, I finished the first layer of refactoring on the main file. I don&#39;t truly know if it counts as (efficient) refactoring, but everything is a <strong>bit</strong> more organized now.</p>
<h3 id="changes-made">Changes Made:</h3>
<ul>
<li>split app.js into build.js and serve.js</li>
<li>instead of manual configuration within serve.js for different subs, a config.js file was created</li>
<li>starting using await for more organized/structured function calls</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="to-be-improved">To be improved:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I&#39;m repeating the same functions just for different edge cases: have to find a way to solve that</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="another-update-07-08">Another Update (07-08)</h2>
<p>I enjoy updating on existing posts, drastically reduces the need for newer posts and there&#39;s this whole sense of connection and progress. I&#39;ve been working on a <a href="/category/">categories</a> page and although it can be improved, I&#39;ve got some basic sorting functionality up and running.</p>
<p>I might think about rewriting the CSS file for more concise declarations because I feel like (once again) I&#39;m just adding more lines for edge-cases that I know can be fixed using efficient syntax. I&#39;m currently using 2 css files: <em>blog.css</em> and <em>main.css</em> which creates a lot of overlap if I don&#39;t pay enough attention.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> (Literally 30 minutes later): I&#39;ve managed to compress my <em>main.css</em> and <em>blog.css</em> files into a singular css file, and I haven&#39;t seen any conflicts yet, although one is bound to arise. I&#39;ll fix that when it arises (not the best practice).</p>
<p>I also enabled the usage of Latex rendering using MathTex through a flag in the front-matter content. If I pass: </p>
<pre><code>tex: true
</code></pre>
<p>at the front of the document (just so I don&#39;t have to call the rendering js file at the beginning of every post).</p>
<p>Currently, the size of my build folder (the one presenting this site) is 280KB, although the src folder takes up 244KB (124KB for fonts, and 112KB for images).</p>
<p>A feature I&#39;d like to add is the Code Chunks as found in R Markdown, where code is written and the output is embedded in the document automatically. Could be an interesting idea (I just really like pretty charts, but who doesn&#39;t).</p>
